704. Binary Search

Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 < nums[i], target < 104
All the integers in nums are unique.
nums is sorted in ascending order.

    while(low<=high){

        if(nums[mid] == target) return mid;
        if(nums[mid] > target) high = mid-1;
        else low = mid+1;
    }
    return -1;
}

int main(){
    vector<int> nums = {-1,0,3,5,9,12};
    int target = 2;
    int ans = search(nums, target);
    cout<<"Printing the answer here "<<ans<<endl;
}

Complexity analysis:

Time complexity: O(logN), where N is the number of elements in the array.
Space complexity: O(1), we are not using any extra space, hence the space complexity is constant.
